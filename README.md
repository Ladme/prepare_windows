# prepare_windows

This script prepares umbrella sampling windows from an arbitrary number of pulling trajectories. Basic validation of the mdp file and ndx files provided is also performed. Requires Gromacs to run.

See `example_windows.txt` for the required format of the 'window_list' file specifying umbrella sampling windows.
See `example_umbrella.mdp` for an example of source umbrella sampling mdp file that can be used by the script.
